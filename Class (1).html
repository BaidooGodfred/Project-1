        <h2>Biomedical Engineering</h2>

        <h3>What is Biomedical Engineering?</h3>
        <p>Biomedical Engineering is a multidisciplinary field that applies engineering principles to medicine and biology. It focuses on designing and developing medical devices, artificial organs, diagnostic machines, and healthcare solutions to improve human health.</p>

        <h3>Breakdown of Biomedical Engineering</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Medical Devices:</strong> Designing equipment like pacemakers, prosthetics, and MRI machines.</li>
            <li><strong>Tissue Engineering:</strong> Creating artificial organs and regenerative medicine.</li>
            <li><strong>Biomechanics:</strong> Studying human movement and designing rehabilitation devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical Imaging:</strong> Developing technologies for X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs.</li>
            <li><strong>Bioinformatics:</strong> Using data science and AI to analyze medical data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why I Chose Biomedical Engineering</h3>
        <p>Since childhood, I have been passionate about medicine and technology. My dream was to become a doctor, but after facing challenges with medical school admission, I found Biomedical Engineering as the perfect intersection between my interests in science, healthcare, and engineering. This field allows me to contribute to medical advancements, innovate healthcare solutions, and still be part of the medical world.</p>
